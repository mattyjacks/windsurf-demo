"MJ-LEAD-SalemNHRestaurant-Oct25-001","78","65","Abbaston Kitchen shows a strong 4.7 rating with 130 Google reviews and a direct online ordering link (Order.online), suggesting steady off-premise demand and an audience that already orders digitally. SwipeBy can expand revenue via done-for-you email remarketing to re-activate past buyers, while review management can keep the rating high as volume grows. Voice AI would reduce missed calls during peak periods and answer menu/availability questions. Social content and ads can highlight rotating specials and late-night hours, driving incremental orders without extra staff effort. Commission-free ordering and loyalty are a good fit for a quality-focused neighborhood concept looking to keep margins strong.","Abbaston Kitchen","https://order.online/store/abbaston-kitchen-salem-34188681/?hideModal=true","+1 603-458-3254","4.7","130","288 N Broadway, Salem, NH 03079"

This scale indicates meaningful repeatable demand that SwipeBy can monetize. Email remarketing and ads automation can lift order frequency, while review responses can improve star distribution over time. Voice AI will handle high call volumes around sports nights and weekends to capture add-on orders. Social media and UGC-style food gallery posts can fuel traffic without expensive agencies.

"MJ-LEAD-SalemNHRestaurant-Oct25-003","85","45","Copper Door is a well-established upscale brand with 2,784 reviews at 4.5 stars, suggesting strong traffic and brand equity. Profit upside is high via segmented remarketing (special events, anniversaries, holidays) and proactive review/reputation management, but enterprise decision cycles may slow adoption. SwipeBy’s voice AI can deflect routine calls (reservations, hours, private dining questions) and free hosts; social and paid campaigns can highlight chef features and limited-time menus. Commission-free ordering and loyalty can support off-premise moments and gift card promos. Expect a more complex stakeholder process, but the ROI case is compelling due to high average check and large audience.","Copper Door","https://copperdoor.com/","+1 603-458-2033","4.5","2784","41 S Broadway, Salem, NH 03079"
