Goodness is basically how good the website is, containg completeness of information and design, and opportunity is the opposite basically how good the opportunity is as a freelancer to improve the website and to easily get the sale to improve the website. Opportunity is also influenced by how open the company seems to new ideas.

Make sure that the "How good the website looks" and "problems with the website" and "notes" all contain at least 300 characters.
