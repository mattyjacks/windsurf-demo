Sections are well labeled, content depth is strong, and calls-to-action are placed logically across the site. Copy is concise yet informative, with team, services, and contact details surfaced in multiple locations. Visual hierarchy, typography, and spacing read cleanly on desktop and mobile. Performance is generally snappy, SSL is configured, and navigation patterns are consistent. Overall, the site communicates credibility and capability effectively for a small technical firm.","Limited client testimonials and third-party social proof are immediately visible on primary pages, and detailed case studies with outcomes, timelines, tech stacks, and quantified results are sparse. Pricing and packaging guidance is not clearly articulated which can slow qualification. Information scent could improve by simplifying top-level navigation and consolidating overlapping sections. Some images lack descriptive alt text, and headings could be more semantically consistent for SEO. Calls-to-action could be diversified (newsletter, discovery call, quote). A lightweight FAQ and trust badges would further reduce friction.","Tech consulting and software development company led by Matt, focusing on AI solutions and freelancer coordination. Strong positioning in custom software and web applications with a clear value proposition. Low-hanging wins include publishing 2–3 in-depth case studies, adding structured testimonials, clarifying engagement models, and introducing a discovery call scheduler.
