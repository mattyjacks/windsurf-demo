# The Clockmaker's Silence

## Chapter 1: The Stranger with No Time

In the small fog-wrapped town of Velmire, no one ever left and no one ever arrived. It was a place where time felt like it crawled in circles; always cloudy, always a little too quiet.

That changed one morning when an unfamiliar man stumbled into town at dawn, drenched from the shoulders down, with an old mechanical clock strapped to his back. It wasn't a regular clock: it had no hands, only a humming at its center, and symbols carved into the brass instead of numbers. The man's name was Iben. Or so he said.

He didn't speak much. He set up a small workshop on the corner of an empty street, fixed watches and repaired broken radios. But the townsfolk noticed something strange: those who had their watches fixed by Iben started to dream... vivid, often disturbing dreams of places they'd never been and events they hadn't lived through.

## Chapter 2: The Dreamkeeper

A boy named Finn, thirteen years old with more curiosity than caution, was the first to notice the pattern. His mother had taken an old stopwatch to Iben, and ever since, she'd been sleepwalking to the cliffs at night, whispering about echoes trapped in metal.

Finn decided to confront Iben.

He stepped into the workshop one rainy afternoon. Inside, the air was filled with the smell of oil, old wood, and something sweet and metallic - like rusted honey. The walls were lined with clocks, none of them ticking.

Iben looked up. His eyes were the color of frostbitten steel.

"You're not here for a fix, are you?" Iben asked.

"No," Finn said. "I think you're doing something to people. To their dreams."

Iben didn't deny it. Instead, he reached under the counter and pulled out a wooden box.

Inside the box were dozens of tiny gears; each engraved with a name.

"One for every soul in Velmire," Iben whispered. "Every gear is a memory. A thread of a life. I repair what was broken. But sometimes... fixing it opens doors."

Finn stared at the gear with his mother's name. The edges were sharp.

"What kind of doors?" he asked.

Iben paused. "Doors to before. Doors to after."

## Chapter 3: The Hour That Time Forgot

That night, Finn found himself caught between sleep and wakefulness: a temporal twilight where minutes stretched like taffy and seconds stuttered like broken film. He followed his mother as she wandered barefoot out of the house, her movements synchronized to a rhythm only she could hear.

She walked past the trees, across the frozen fields, and toward the rusted lighthouse... abandoned since the fire years ago, when time itself had seemed to burn.

Inside, the air was thick with ash and something else: *chronos* - the sound of time itself breathing. Not music. Not voices. Just... the universe keeping count.

There, in the heart of the blackened tower, stood a clock he had never seen before. It was as tall as the ceiling, with symbols matching the ones on Iben's device. But this one had hands; twelve of them, all moving in opposite directions, as if time were arguing with itself.

His mother stepped forward and touched the clock face.

It stopped.

The silence that followed was violent: a temporal vacuum that sucked the *now* right out of the world.

When Finn blinked, he was no longer in the lighthouse. He was in a city he had never seen, full of lights and smoke and machines that moved without wheels... a place where *when* had become *where*. A man in a silver coat handed him a gear and said, "You're out of time."

Then, a flash. Another scene: he was older now, sitting across from Iben in the workshop. The clocks were ticking again, but backwards - unwinding the hours like thread from a spool. Iben had no eyes, only sockets filled with black sand that fell upward.

Another flash: Velmire, empty. Everyone gone. The sky above torn like paper, exposing a spiraling mechanism grinding slowly in the heavens: the clockwork of eternity laid bare.

And then he was back; his mother collapsed on the lighthouse floor, the great clock gone as if it had never existed. But in his pocket, he found a single gear, still warm, engraved with a word he couldn't read but somehow understood: *Remember*.

## Chapter 4: Time Unwound

Over the next few weeks, more people in Velmire fell into sleepwalking trances. Iben's shop stayed closed, its windows covered in soot.

Finn, still shaken, took the wooden box of gears and hid it in the forest. But the dreams did not stop. They changed. Became clearer.

People began speaking in their sleep... languages from other times. Some spoke Latin. Others, something that sounded like whale songs or static.

One night, Finn returned to the forest. The box was gone. In its place, a single note:

*Time is not a line. It is a wound. And wounds do not forget.*

## Chapter 5: The Clockmaker's Silence

Years passed. Velmire became a ghost town. No one aged. No one died. The clocks no longer worked, but the people continued - trapped in a repeating year, where the date on every calendar was December 31st.

Finn, now grown, stayed. Not out of fear, but responsibility.

And beneath the old lighthouse, he built his own workshop. Not to fix time: but to bury it.

Because some things... some doors... should never be opened again.
