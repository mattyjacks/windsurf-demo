The Clockmakers Silence
Chapter 1: The Stranger with No Time
In the small fog-wrapped town of Velmire, no one ever left and no one ever arrived. It was a place
where time felt like it crawled in circlesalways cloudy, always a little too quiet.
That changed one morning when an unfamiliar man stumbled into town at dawn, drenched from the
shoulders down, with an old mechanical clock strapped to his back. It wasnt a regular clockit had no
hands, only a humming at its center, and symbols carved into the brass instead of numbers. The
mans name was Iben. Or so he said.
He didnt speak much. He set up a small workshop on the corner of an empty street, fixed watches
and repaired broken radios. But the townsfolk noticed something strange: those who had their
watches fixed by Iben started to dreamvivid, often disturbing dreams of places theyd never been
and events they hadnt lived through.
Chapter 2: The Dreamkeeper
A boy named Finn, thirteen years old with more curiosity than caution, was the first to notice the
pattern. His mother had taken an old stopwatch to Iben, and ever since, shed been sleepwalking to
the cliffs at night, whispering about echoes trapped in metal.
Finn decided to confront Iben.
He stepped into the workshop one rainy afternoon. Inside, the air was filled with the smell of oil, old
wood, and something sweet and metalliclike rusted honey. The walls were lined with clocks, none of
them ticking.
Iben looked up. His eyes were the color of frostbitten steel.
Youre not here for a fix, are you? Iben asked.
No, Finn said. I think youre doing something to people. To their dreams.
Iben didnt deny it. Instead, he reached under the counter and pulled out a wooden box.
Inside the box were dozens of tiny gearseach engraved with a name.
One for every soul in Velmire, Iben whispered. Every gear is a memory. A thread of a life. I repair
what was broken. But sometimes... fixing it opens doors.
Finn stared at the gear with his mothers name. The edges were sharp.
What kind of doors? he asked.
Iben paused. Doors to before. Doors to after.
Chapter 3: The Forgotten Hour
That night, Finn did not sleep. Instead, he followed his mother as she wandered barefoot out of the
house. She walked past the trees, across the frozen fields, and toward the rusted
lighthouseabandoned since the fire years ago.
Inside, the air was thick with ash and something else: sound. Not music. Not voices. Just... ticking.
There, in the heart of the blackened tower, stood a clock he had never seen before. It was as tall as
the ceiling, with symbols matching the ones on Ibens device. But this one had handstwelve of them,
all moving in opposite directions.
His mother stepped forward and touched the clock.
It stopped.
The silence that followed was violent.
When Finn blinked, he was no longer in the lighthouse. He was in a city he had never seen, full of
lights and smoke and machines that moved without wheels. A man in a silver coat handed him a
gear and said, Youre out of time.
Then, a flash. Another scene: he was older now, sitting across from Iben in the workshop. The
clocks were ticking again. Iben had no eyes, only sockets filled with black sand.
Another flash: Velmire, empty. Everyone gone. The sky above torn like paper, exposing a spiraling
mechanism grinding slowly in the heavens.
And then he was backhis mother collapsed on the lighthouse floor. The great clock gone.
Chapter 4: Time Unwound
Over the next few weeks, more people in Velmire fell into sleepwalking trances. Ibens shop stayed
closed, its windows covered in soot.
Finn, still shaken, took the wooden box of gears and hid it in the forest. But the dreams did not stop.
They changed. Became clearer.
People began speaking in their sleeplanguages from other times. Some spoke Latin. Others,
something that sounded like whale songs or static.
One night, Finn returned to the forest. The box was gone. In its place, a single note:
Time is not a line. It is a wound. And wounds do not forget.
Chapter 5: The Clockmakers Silence
Years passed. Velmire became a ghost town. No one aged. No one died. The clocks no longer
worked, but the people continuedtrapped in a repeating year, where the date on every calendar was
December 31st.
Finn, now grown, stayed. Not out of fear, but responsibility.
And beneath the old lighthouse, he built his own workshop. Not to fix timebut to bury it.
Because some things... some doors... should never be opened again.
